Simple Shooter
=============

play here: http://jetucker.ca/unity/build.html

WASD to move and left click to fire. Don't hit the yellow enemies, pick up the orange particles for points.

Old unity project from about 2012. Built for the purpose of learning how to use Unity and javascript.

The game itself is simple arcade shooter that never ends. Emphasis on the simple, no power ups, levels, or alternate ammo.
Just a never ending stream of enemies.
